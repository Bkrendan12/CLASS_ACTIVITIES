## 💡 Hints

How can we use the `margin` property to define space between elements?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What is the CSS `float` property?

<!-- completed -->
it's used when you want an element to be pushed to the left or right of it's parent container and the text inside of the container will wrap said floating element. If left or right isnt specified as it's float value, it will stay on it's own line and pushing the text to its own line underneath it. Floating objects are naturally blocked-displayed which means they have their own line.
